Ideate prototype 2:

In this prototype we don't want to change anything that we have in the game but rather we want to expand it to help
the issues in the first iteration.. we decided to:

  - Add pickups:
      With these we are trying to encourage the players to move more through all the screen making it more exiting  
      (we ended up adding two pickups a money bag and a power up that gives you a faster gun for a certain time)

  - Add variation in the asteroids:
      With this we are trying to make the game less monotonous so the player wonâ€™t get bored easily
