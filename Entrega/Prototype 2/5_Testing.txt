Testing prototype 2:

 - Better movement:
      Players went out of their way to get the pickups, they liked that the asteroids could move in different directions or collide with themselves making it harder to destroy 

 - More powerful:
      Players enjoyed the powerup because they could destroy more asteroids that way

 - Not unique:
       There are a lot of space shooters in the market, so the players werenâ€™t impressed by the game
