Testing prototype 1:

 - people liked the scoring system:
      they seem to enjoy getting points for the time played but they preferred destroying the asteroids rather 
      than avoid them because like that they get more points

 - too monotonous:
       there is not much variety in the game and even if the asteroids moved faster as time went by 
       the players got bored of the game quickly

 - not Movement
     The players spent most of their time at the bottom of the screen and didnâ€™t move up and down
