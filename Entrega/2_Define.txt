Space shooter:

- Player must be able to keep score:
      player likes to beat their own score or their friend's score so scoring system is a must

- Player can destroy the objects or avoid them
      player likes to feel powerful (destroying stuff) and exited (avoiding stuff) so we have to include ths mechanics

- Player must move through all the screen       
     for better control, this is tied to the feeling of power as well

- Set on space (?    
    Is a space shooter after all
